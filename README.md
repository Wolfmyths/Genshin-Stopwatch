## What does Genshin Stopwatch do?

Genshin Stopwatch is a program that makes checking timers easier without launching the game (Examples: Stamina, Fishing, Gardening, Enemy Respawns, Parametric Transformer, etc...).

<img src="/img/stopwatch_demo.PNG" alt="Windows version of Genshin Stopwatch">

## How are my stopwatches saved?
When you create a stopwatch or close the application, your stopwatches will save to the `save.txt` file. The save file is easily configurable and easy to read.

Here is an example of a stopwatch's save data in `save.txt`:
```
[2589221199520]
name = Respawns
time finished = 2023-05-28 11:34:14
time original duration = 12:00:00
border color = #37AA9C
notes = Hilichurl Camps
```

## What platforms is this compatible with?

Win 10 and up, MacOS, and Linux versions are available.

MacOS/Linux versions are not tested so if there's any issues please submit an issue

**Android and iOS is also underway! Release TBD**

## It doesn't work!

**Please make sure you're on the latest version**

**Before submitting a bug report please check the known bugs in the latest release notes before telling me.**

**On Windows: The program is accessible through the system tray** *(Up arrow next to the volume mixer)* **when running in the background.**

+ Check `save.txt` and make sure it looks in a similar format to the example above.
+ The program needs `save.txt` and `config.ini` to start, so if there isn't one in the directory create a text file with the same name or redownload the program.
+ Genshin Stopwatch only works on `Windows`.
+ Check `config.ini` and make sure it looks similar to when you downloaded the program.
+ If you upgraded from a version below 1.4 to 1.4+ but kept your `save.txt` and `settings.txt` the same, then you have outdated save/setting file formats. Please see [save/settings rewrite](https://github.com/Wolfmyths/Genshin-Stopwatch/releases/tag/V1.4) if you want to keep your settings/stopwatches

If you found a bug or crash, please report it to me and show how to replicate the issue if possible.<br>

## Does this program run on system startup?

Yes! But you have to do a couple steps to do so, follow the instructions below.

### On Windows:
1. Create a shortcut of the .exe
2. Press `win + r`
3. Type in `shell:startup` this will take you to your startup directory
4. Place the shortcut in folder

**You can disable run on startup by going to** `task manager -> startup` 

### On MacOS:
1. Click the Apple icon and click `System Settings`
2. Go to `General -> Login Items`
3. Click the plus button then `Applications -> Select the app -> Open`

**You may need to enable** `Allow in the Background`

### On Linux:
Every distro is different so you have to do this research on your own, sorry. üòì

## Future Plans?

+ Background pictures to choose from for the timers?
+ Translations? *(Not sure if this is necessary but if people want it I will make an effort)*
+ Mobile version? *In development! Release is still TBD*

If you have a suggestion let me know on the issues page or DM me on my socials!
